title = Geomax A200-37 Ammonia Tank
manufacturer = Geomax Plc.
description = Although almost identically sized to the Rockomax-32 Fuel Tank, this fuel tank by Geomax contains Ammonia which is lower density than competing fuels allowing bigger numbers to be involved in the marketing process. More practically, Compaired to Hydrogen, Ammonia will allow nuclear engines to generate 190% more thrust while only 37% reduction in ISP. Also compaired to Liquid Hydrogen, Ammonia is more than 9 times as dense and does not require cryogenic storage.
