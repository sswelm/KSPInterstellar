description = A large Tokamak based fusion reactor design, unlike the smaller models, these design use large magnetic coils to contain the plasma within a helical magnetic field.  The plasma is then heated to enormous temperatures using microwaves and an applied current. These designs are best suited to use with Deuterium/Tritium plasmas.
